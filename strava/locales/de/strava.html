    <p>Get your most recent activity on Strava.</p>

    <p>This node returns the most recent activity in the authenticated user's account
    whenever it receives a message.</p>

    <p>Should an activity be available, the following is set on the message:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>msg.payload is being set to the JavaScript Activity object as served by Strava.</li>
            <li>msg.location.lat and msg.location.lon is being set to the activity's start location if such location is available</li>
            <li>msg.time is a JavaScript date object representing the start of the activity, if such data is available. The date is set in UTC (zulu) time.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>If there are no available activities or if an error occurs, the node simply forwards the incoming message.</p>
