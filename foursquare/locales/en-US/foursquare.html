    <p>Foursquare query node.</p>
    <p>Can be used to
    <ul>
        <li>explore recommended venues of a particular type near a given latitude and longitude </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>The type of venue to explore can be passed in as settings on the node or as the
    <b>msg.payload.section</b> of the message input. Valid entries are:
    <ul>
       <li>food</li>
       <li>drinks</li>
       <li>coffee</li>
       <li>shops</li>
       <li>arts</li>
       <li>outdoors</li>
       <li>sights</li>
       <li>all</li>
    </ul>
    The value set on the node will take precedence over the contents of <b>msg.payload.section</b>.
    </p>
    <p>The number of results to return from the query and how to return them (either as a single message
    or as multiple messages) are settings on the node.</p>
   <p>The node sets the following properties
     <ul>
       <li><b>payload</b> - the JSON of the recommended venue</li>
       <li><b>title</b> - the name of the recommended venue</li>
       <li><b>location.lat</b> - the latitude of the recommended venue</li>
       <li><b>location.lon</b> - the longitude of the recommended venue</li>
       <li><b>location.city</b> - the city where the recommended venue is</li>
       <li><b>location.country</b> - the country where the recommended venue is</li>
       <li><b>location.name</b> - the name of the recommended venue</li>
    </ul>
    The exact location of these properties depends on the number of results chosen to be returned along
    with how to return them:
    <ul>
    <li>If the node output value is set to one then for both returning as a single message and as multiple
    messages, the node returns a msg for the first in an ordered list of recommended venues near the provided
    latitude and longitude. The returned msg has the payload, location and name properties.
    </li>
    <li>If the node output value is set to more than one to be returned as a single message
    the node sets <b>msg.payload</b>
    to be an array of <b>msg</b>'s, each one corresponding to a recommended venue and ordered according to the
    <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> venues explore API.  The first element in the array is
    the most highly recommended venue and the length of the array is the output value set on the node or the
    number of venues found, whichever is smaller. Each element in this array has the payload,
   title, location and name properties.
    </li>
    <li>If the node output value is set to more than one but to be returned as a multiple then the node sends
    multiple msgs, each one representing a recommended venue.
    </ul>
